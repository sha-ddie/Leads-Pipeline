## Problem Statement

Small teams and growing businesses that lack dedicated CRM systems often struggle to manage leads effectively.  
This project was developed **to address a real-world challenge encountered in my day-to-day work**, where the absence of a streamlined lead management process resulted in:

- Leads scattered across emails and spreadsheets  
- Missed follow-ups and inconsistencies in communication  
- No unified or visible sales pipeline  
- Inefficient collaboration among team members  

These challenges highlighted the need for a **simple, affordable, flexible, and Google-native solution** that centralizes lead information, improves workflow efficiency, and automates repetitive tasks.

4. Offer a low-cost, CRM-like solution suitable for small teams.  
5. Allow easy customization and seamless deployment within Google Workspace.  
6. Deliver a clean, user-friendly frontend using HTML and CSS.
